hello hello hello
how low 
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us

I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
